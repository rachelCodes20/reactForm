# Scratch User Form With React
> React, Parcel, and CSS were used to build and design the user form.

### Componentizing
> In an effort to adhere to the single responsibility principle and ensure maintainability of the application, components and hooks have been placed into separate components.

### Optimizations
> One security feature I was able to implement was setting a minimum number of characters but other optimizations could include setting a max length as well as pattern restictions. 

> The "checkFormFields" function should ensure that the values of the input object have all been entered before allowing for the post request to the endpoint. There is currently a bug in this function but essentially, this is the idea.  

> Aria labels would be an excellent accessibility optimization for the application as well, further assisting with assistive technology.

### Accessibility
> In an attempt to increase the accessibility of the application, lable elements were used to aid screen readers and user with memory loss. Text was set at a minimum of 16px, and providing color contrast between foreground and background colors.
